Okay so itll be a little confusing but i tried adding comments where i could, you first want to start by making sure something is in the database and that you have your hashes.csv file locally stored under data
After this ( i belive ) you can just run API_LocalComparison.py and itll handle it, Osama is going to have to use that result to code his section, you can ust use the fron ... import... stuff but yeah
There MAY be an issue in API_LocalComparison.py where its using my ayuth code in the beginning but you can apply for your own for free on the malwareabazaar api site easily for free should only take a few minutes
If for some reason running API_LocalComparison.py isnt working you can try runnung in this order getRecentAPIData.py >> localHashes_Check.py >> API local comparison, it shouldnt have to come to that because im already importing the functions from those other two into the localcomparison code but just incase
Any questions just ask me or dennis
