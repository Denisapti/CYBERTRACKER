The update_hashes.py module automates the process of keeping the local MalwareBazaar hash dataset up to date. 
Instead of manually downloading and replacing the CSV file, this script automatically downloads the latest dataset, 
compares it with the existing local version, and updates the database only if changes are detected. 
This helps ensure the system always works with the most recent threat intelligence data while avoiding unnecessary database rebuilds.

What the script does:
Downloads the latest CSV dataset from MalwareBazaar
Compares the new file with the existing hashes.csv using SHA-256 hashing
Detects whether the dataset has changed
Replaces the old CSV file if an update is detected
Rebuilds the database using import_hashes.py
Skips the rebuild process if no changes are found
